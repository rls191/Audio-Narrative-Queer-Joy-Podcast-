# Audio Narrative Queer Joy 
 All project materials live in audio narrative 

Summary: In this project, I am highlighting what queer joy means to me! I specifically cover the gay bar scene in Pittsburgh and feature an interview with a  Pittsburgh drag queen. I focus a lot on the Pittsburgh drag scene and what defines it.
